# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Assignment Description
[Project Outline Assignment](https://education.launchcode.org/liftoff/modules/assignments/project-outline)

### Overview

This project will be a portal in which non-profit organizations and charities can find interested volunteer and donor candidates, and vice versa. An organization will register as a user, create a profile, interact with individual users while promoting their causes via a tagging system. As a registered user, organizations will update or delete their account as needed.

Additionally, individuals will be able to sign-up for a user account, create a profile, and search for charitable causes or volunteer opportunities through the same tagging system.

This project has many opportunities for stretch features, such as: tracking volunteer hours, volunteer experience and opportunity feed, Google geolocation integration and more.

### Features

Multi-level user account creation and authentication: Volunteers and organizations will both be allowed to create accounts, with differing access rights and permissions.

Tagging system with search and list functionality: Organizations will be able to link various tags to their organization detailing what “causes” they are involved in. Users will be able to search for these non-profits via the same tag system.

Automatic database CRUD: Users of various types and causes will be automatically held in persistent, application-created tables and be able to edit their profile as needed.

### Technologies

IntelliJ, Spring Boot, Java, Hibernate (JPA), Thymeleaf, Bootstrap, & MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn

At this juncture, we have several possible areas of increased learning. Creating various levels of user access and permissions is something that we have not been exposed to yet. Having the two main user groups with two-way searching is also a new area of possible development. Authentication options have not been determined yet, but there will be much to learn in that area.
